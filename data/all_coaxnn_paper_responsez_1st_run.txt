Question 3: What future studies will be explored in CoAxNN?
Answer 3: Future studies in CoAxNN will include exploring other genetic algorithms such as NPGA for multiobjective optimization and setting different pruning ratios for different layers to further improve performance.

Question: What are the different sensitives for model accuracy?
Answer: Different layers have different sensitives for model accuracy.

     Question: What will be explored in future studies?
Answer: Setting different pruning ratios for different layers can potentially further improve the performance, which will be explored in future studies.

     Question: What is the conclusion of the paper?
Answer: In this paper, we proposed an efficient optimization framework, CoAxNN, which effectively combines staging-based with pruning-based approximate strategies for efficient model inference on resource-constrained edge devices.
