Question 1: What is the problem with magnetic propulsion?,"Answer:  The problem with magnetic propulsion is that magnets always come with two poles, a north pole and a south pole. If you place a magnet in the Earth's magnetic field, it will simply spin (like a compass needle) rather than rise in the air like a UFO; as the south pole of a magnet moves one way, the north pole moves the opposite way, so the magnet spins and goes nowhere.","Question 1: What is the problem with magnetic propulsion?

The butterfly effect in weather forecasting refers to the idea that even the smallest perturbations, such as the flapping of a butterfly's wings, can cause significant changes in the atmosphere and ultimately impact the weather. In other words, it is impossible to accurately predict the weather more than a few hours in advance because the complex interactions between atmospheric particles make it too difficult for computers to simulate the behavior of the atmosphere.2. Predicting the weather a century from now is impossible because the atmosphere becomes too turbulent and complex over time, making any computer simulation useless after just a few hours.
